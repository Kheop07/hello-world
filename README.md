# hello-world
This is my First Repository

May Allah pardon me for my sins. Now that Ive said that. Hello World!!! I'm so glad to be here. Ive been saying to myself that I would learn how to code, and now im on the journey. May Allah bless what I create, and may what I create be of great use to the world.
